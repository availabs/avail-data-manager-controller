    > Reliable messages for Moleculer services via external
    > queue/channel/topic. Unlike moleculer built-in events, this is not a
    > fire-and-forget solution. It's a persistent, durable and reliable message
    > sending solution. The module uses an external message queue/streaming
    > server that stores messages until they are successfully processed. It
    > supports consumer groups, which means that you can run multiple instances
    > of consumer services, incoming messages will be balanced between them.

    > **This project is a work-in-progress. Don't use it in production.**
