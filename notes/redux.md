> **Building on the duck legacy**
>
> Before starting, read more about the original
> [ducks modular approach proposal](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).
> When trying to embrace this idea in medium-large scale codebases I noticed
> that the single duck file becomes harder and harder to maintain and read.
>
> So I want to propose an extended approach that works great when you go beyond
> a todo-app.
>
> To recap, a duck:
>
> -   MUST export default a function called reducer()
> -   MUST export its action creators as functions
> -   MUST have action types in the form npm-module-or-app/reducer/ACTION_TYPE
> -   MAY export its action types as UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, if an external reducer
>     needs to listen for them, or if it is a published reusable library
