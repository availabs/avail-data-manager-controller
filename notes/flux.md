## [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

> Redux can be described in three fundamental principles:
>
> -   Single source of truth
>
>     The global state of your application is stored in an object tree within a
>     single store.
>
> -   State is read-only
>
>     The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object
>     describing what happened.
>
> -   Changes are made with pure functions
>
>     To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.

## [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)

> MobX is inspired by reactive programming principles as found in the
> spreadsheets. It is inspired by MVVM frameworks like MeteorJS tracker,
> knockout and Vue.js, but MobX brings Transparent Functional Reactive
> Programming to the next level and provides a standalone implementation. It
> implements TFRP in a glitch-free, synchronous, predictable and efficient
> manner.

## [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)

> Recoil lets you create a data-flow graph that flows from atoms (shared state)
> through selectors (pure functions) and down into your React components. Atoms
> are units of state that components can subscribe to. Selectors transform this
> state either synchronously or asynchronously.
