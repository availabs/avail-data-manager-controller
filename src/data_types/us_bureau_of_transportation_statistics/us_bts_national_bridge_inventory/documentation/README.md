> AS4F-1 A W## - waterway or a F## - relief for waterway feature type should be
> reported when a bridge spans over water. This applies whether the water
> source is perennial or intermittent, including if flow exists only during
> flood stage. A W## feature type is reported for each unique waterway spanned
> by the bridge. A bridge that spans a single unique waterway and/or its
> associated floodplain, will have a single feature reported. Also, a bridge
> that spans multiple channels or branches of the same unique waterway will
> have a single feature reported. A bridge that spans more than one unique
> waterway, although very rare, will have multiple features reported (i.e.,
> W01, W02).
>
> A F## feature type is reported for relief bridges that provide waterway opening
> for flow only during flood stages and furnish additional hydraulic capacity.
>
> A W## and separate F## feature type would be reported only when the bridge
> spans a waterway and a separate relief channel is constructed in the
> floodplain; this would be a very rare condition.
