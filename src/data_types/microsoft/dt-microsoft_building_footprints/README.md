> Data Vintage
>
> The vintage of the footprints depends on the vintage of the underlying imagery.
> Bing Imagery is a composite of multiple sources with different capture dates.
> Each building footprint has a capture date tag associated if we were able to
> deduce the vintage of imagery source.
> 
> Footprints inside the highlighted region on the map are from 2019-2020. There
> are 73,250,745 such building footprints. This is the focal area where we rerun
> extraction for the latest release.
> 
> The rest of the footprints were extracted from older images, having wider range
> of capture dates, averaging 2012 year approximately. We have reused footprints
> from previous releases in this area.
