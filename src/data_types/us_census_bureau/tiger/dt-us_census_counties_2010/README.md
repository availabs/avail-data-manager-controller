  * States are the primary political (administrative) divisions of the United
    States of America. The U.S. consists of fifty states, the District of
    Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories.

  * Counties are the primary political and administrative divisions of states. In
    the state of Louisiana, however, these divisions are known as parishes. The
    state of Alaska is another exception, organized into boroughs and census
    areas. The District of Columbia, which also does not have any county
    divisions, is considered equivalent to a county for statistical purposes.

  * County Subdivisions fall within counties. Since each state organizes its
    governments differently, there are some states where the county subdivisions
    are established legal entities known as Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs). In the
    rest of the states, county subdivisions are known as Census County Divisions
    (CCDs) and exist for statistical purposes.

  * Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a
    county. In areas where no local participant existed or where local or tribal
    governments declined to participate, the U.S. Census Bureau delineated census
    tracts in those areas. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a
    stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data.
    Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum
    size of 4,000 people. 

  * Census Block Groups are statistical divisions of census tracts and composed
    of clusters of census blocks. A census block group consists of all census
    blocks whose numbers begin with the same digit in a given census tract. Block
    groups typically contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size
    of 1,500.

  * Census Blocks are the smallest geographic unit for which the Census Bureau
    collects data. Blocks represent streets, roads, and railroads, bodies of
    water, and other visible physical and cultural features. Census blocks are
    numbered uniquely with a four-digit census block number from 0000 to 9999
    within census tract which nest within state and county. Census blocks are not
    delineated based on population.
