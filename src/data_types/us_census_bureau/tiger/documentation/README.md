> **Census Tracts**
> * Small, permanent, consistent statistical divisions of a county
> * Optimally contains 4,000 people; range between 1,200 and 8,000
>
> **Block Groups**
> * Smallest units for tabulation of sample data
> * Population ranges from 600 to 3,000
>
> **Blocks**
> * Smallest units for 100% data tabulation
> * Cover entire nation
> * Nest within all other types of geographic areas
> * Generally bounded by visible features or boundaries

> **Geographic Hierarchy**
> 
> <br/>
> The Standard Hierarchy of Census Geographic Entities (also available as a PDF
> below) shows the many geographic types for which data are available from the
> U.S. Census Bureau.
> <br/>
> <br/>
> With connecting lines, the diagram shows the hierarchical relationships
> between geographic types. For example, a line extends from states to counties
> because a state is comprised of many counties, and a single county can never
> cross a state boundary.
> <br/>
> <br/>
> If no line joins two geographic types, then an absolute and predictable
> relationship does not exist between them.
> <br/>
> <br/>
> For example, many places are confined to one county. However, some places
> extend over more than one county, such as New York City. Therefore, an
> absolute hierarchical relationship does not exist between counties and
> places, and any tabulation involving both these geographic types may
> represent only a part of one county or one place.
> <br/>
> <br/>
> Notice that many lines radiate from blocks, indicating that most geographic
> types can be described as a collection of blocks, the smallest geographic
> unit for which the Census Bureau reports data. However, only two of these
> lines also describe the path by which a block is uniquely named. That is, the
> path through the Block Group or through the Tribal Block Group.
